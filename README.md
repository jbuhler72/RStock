# RStock
Using R to study stocks

shortStock_AMZN.R : is R code that will take data from Quandl and get all the shorts from Amazon, I want to be able to use one file to read many stocks. I did create a Mysql database to store the short data. My goal in this file is to get more stock data for shorts then just Amazon. And I want to also run Quandl to analyse more then just shorts.

#createTables.sql
is the current data structure for mysql I am takeing the data using R and putting it into tables

My goal is to use Yii to show all of the data in trends and comparisons.
