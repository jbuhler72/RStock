# RStock
Using R to study stocks

shortStock_AMZN.R : is R code that will take data from Quandl and get all the shorts from Amazon, I want to be able to use one fill to read many stocks. I did creata a Mysql database to store the shot data. My goal is to use Yii to show all of the data in trends and comparisons I will like to get more stock data then just shorts.

createTables.sql is the current data structure for mysql I am takeing the data using R and putting it into tables
