# RStock
Using R to study stocks

shortStock_AMZN.R : is R code that will take data from Quandl and get all the shorts from Amazon, I want to be able to use one file to read many stocks. I did create a Mysql database to store the short data. My goal is to use Yii to show all of the data in trends and comparisons. My goal in this file is to get more stock data for shorts then just Amazon.

createTables.sql is the current data structure for mysql I am takeing the data using R and putting it into tables
